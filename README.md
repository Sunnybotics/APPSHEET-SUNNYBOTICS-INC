# APPSHEET-SUNNYBOTICS-INC

The collection of uploaded information represents the basis for the creation of the application, the structure for uploading, storing and implementing the data; by implementing the tools that AppSheet provides for the development and creation of applications, creates the first iterations for the development of a more robust application, with larger databases and more precise control of the information. The documentation presented, shows the first advances in the design of applications and how this leads us to the creation of innovative solutions to the challenges we face in the management of our projects. At SUNNYBOTICS, we are committed to providing the best service to our customers and making our processes efficient for our employees. 


## TECHNICAL SYNOPSIS.

The application developed in AppSheet is designed to comprehensively manage the maintenance and inspection of equipment. Its main objective is to provide an efficient platform for recording, tracking and analyzing maintenance activities, ensuring traceability of inspections and detailed monitoring of equipment status.

### Key features include

➡  Activity Logging: Enables detailed recording of maintenance activities, including type, date, technician and observations. This facilitates accurate tracking of each intervention performed.

➡  Task and Inspection Control: The application includes functionality to record and control tasks and inspections performed, ensuring organized and effective management of scheduled activities.

➡  Report generation: It integrates a function to generate and download PDF reports on work orders, facilitating the creation of detailed reports and maintenance planning.

➡  User Interface: The application has a friendly and easy-to-use interface, with well-structured sections for intuitive navigation and clear recording of information.

## METHODOLOGY.

➡ Initial design and development:
+ Activities: Activities began with the creation of the basic structure of the application, developing the necessary sections to fill the formats requested by the maintenance team. Progress was made in the integration of essential functionalities and the initial operation of the application was verified.

➡ Progress and continuous development:
Activities: The five main required sections were integrated, additional sections were added to meet the team's requirements, and the integration of support images began. Additional information was requested to complete data migration and robotic equipment inspection modules were implemented.

➡ Integration of advanced functionality:
Activities: Sections were integrated to store detailed information and adjustments were made to the data visualization. Work was done on the correct integration of the technical names of the parts and on the functionality of the inspection system.

➡ Validation and final adjustments:
Activities: A thorough validation of the application sections was performed to verify functionality and correct data storage. Pending areas were identified, such as the functionality of the "Print Work Order" button and the download of PDF documents.

➡ Testing and Feedback:
Activities: The maintenance team implemented the application in real working conditions for the testing phase. It was planned to receive feedback to adjust and improve the application before its final release.

➡ Documentation and deployment:
Activities: The functional documentation of the application was created and delivered, including a user guide and a Canva presentation detailing each section of the application.Results Achieved: The application was completed and delivered with 100% compliance to the objectives set. All required functionality was included, although areas for future improvement were identified based on feedback received.
