The collection of uploaded information represents the basis for the creation of the application, the structure for uploading, storing and implementing the data; by implementing the tools that AppSheet provides for the development and creation of applications, creates the first iterations for the development of a more robust application, with larger databases and more precise control of the information. The documentation presented, shows the first advances in the design of applications and how this leads us to the creation of innovative solutions to the challenges we face in the management of our projects. At SUNNYBOTICS, we are committed to providing the best service to our customers and making our processes efficient for our employees. 


## TECHNICAL SYNOPSIS

The application developed in AppSheet is designed to comprehensively manage the registration and execution of operations. Its main objective is to provide an efficient platform for registration, monitoring and analysis of customer information, projects and planned, ongoing or completed cleaning of solar systems, ensuring traceability of information and detailed monitoring of operations.

### Key features include

➡ Operations logging: The application allows detailed recording of all operational activities, including information about the customer, project, budgets, days of operation, personnel, robotic equipment and observations. This facilitates accurate tracking of each operation performed.
Planning: The application has specific sections for recording and planning future operations. It allows you to manage the status of operations at different stages: planning, in execution, in progress, not started and completed.

➡ Intuitive sections: The application offers dedicated sections for each area of the company, adapted to the specific needs of each unit. This allows a clear separation of information and provides adequate space for each function. 

➡ Report generation: The application allows the generation of detailed reports on the per diems spent in each field operation, facilitating the comparison between the actual and planned budget.

➡ Post-mortem analysis: The application includes tools to perform a detailed analysis of the expenses of the operations, allowing a comparison between the costs and the profits obtained from each operation carried out.

➡ Dashboard: The application presents several dashboards customized for each business unit, with specific sections of interest for each team member.

➡ User interface: The application has a user-friendly and easy-to-use interface, with well-structured sections for intuitive navigation and clear recording of information.


## METHODOLOGY

➡ Planning and initial development:

+ Activities: The activities started with the creation of the basic structure of the application, the development of the necessary sections for the creation of the application. Progress was made in the integration of essential functionalities and the initial operation of the application was verified.

➡ Progress and continuous development:

+ Activities: The five main required sections were integrated, additional sections were added to meet the team's needs, and the integration of supporting images began. Additional information was requested to complete the data migration and modules were implemented for the different work teams.

➡ Integration of advanced functionality:

+ Activities: Sections were integrated to store detailed information and adjustments were made to the data visualization. Work was done on the correct integration of the technical names of the parts and on the functionality of the information management system.

➡ Validation and final adjustments:

+ Activities: A thorough validation of the application sections was performed to verify their functionality and correct data storage. 

➡ Testing and feedback:

+ Activities: The different teams implemented the application in real working conditions for the testing phase. It was planned to receive feedback in order to adapt and improve the application before its release.

➡ Documentation and delivery:

+ Activities: The functional documentation of the application was prepared and delivered, including a user guide and a presentation in Canva detailing each section of the application.
Results Achieved: The application was completed and delivered with 100% compliance to the set objectives. All required functionality was included.
